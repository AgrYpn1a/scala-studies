#+title: OOP Inheritance

* Definitions
*Subclass* is a class that inherits another class. Usually, any class may have any number of
subclasses.
*Superclass* is a parent of a class. It is a class from which the current class inherits. A
class is usually restricted to having a single superclass (Java, Scala), however in some
languages that support the multiple inheritance this is not the case (C++).
